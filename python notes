# python notes w3schools
print("Hello, World!")

#if statement: you have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, 
# otherwise you get an error. also you can decide how much to indent, but usually 4.
if 5 > 2:
    print("5 is greater than 2!")

#variables in python: there is no way to declare a variable in python 
x = 5
y = "Hello World!"
 
 #okay great so going along with the no declaring variable thing. 
 # you can declare it technically, but it just assumes what it is. it's easier to show w example
 x = 4 #wow ! int!
 x = "slay" #wow! string!

 #for specifiying data type of a variable, you can cast it!
 x = str(3) #so x will be '3'
 x = int(3) # x will be 3
 x = float(3) #x will be 3.0 

 #wow! you can also get the class type by using the command type!!

 x = 5
 y = "slay"
 print(type(x))
 print(type(y)) 
 # this will print out <class 'int'> and <class 'str'>

 #okay lets move on to variable names.
# not much. a variable has to start w a letter or underscore. and it's case sensitive.

# omg u can assign multiple values to different things!! wow!!
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
# this will print 
# Orange
# Banana
# Cherry 

#or if u want, you can be extra 
x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
 # this will print out orange three times! wow!

 #ok queen lets unpack this. 
 fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

# this will assign x to apple, y to banana and z to cherry!

# print 
x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)
# prints Python is awesome 

x = 5
y = "John"
print(x, y)
#prints 5 John (for different types)

x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  x = "fantastic"
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)
#prints out Python is fantastic and then Python is awesome. 
#global variables rewrite variables in the global scope! that's why they're global.
